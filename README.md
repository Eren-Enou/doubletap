# Doubletap CRM
### Group 3

In this project, we continued to refine our **HTML** and **CSS** skills while also practicing collaboration via **Github**.

We created a website for a fictitious technology named Doubletap. The site consists of four pages, each made by one group member:
* Jeff Jacobson made the *Landing* page
* Aaron Molnar made the *How it works* page
* Keith Williams made the *Login* page
* Yosef Wolday made the *Signup* page

Thanks for taking a look at our work!
