# Doubletap CRM
### Group 3

In this project, we continued to refine our **HTML** and **CSS** skills while also practicing collaboration via **Github**.

We created a website for a fictitious technology named Doubletap. The site consists of four pages, each made by one group member:
* [Jeff Jacobson](https://github.com/jwjacobson "Jeff's Github") made the *Landing* page
* [Aaron Molnar](https://github.com/Eren-Enou "Aaron's Github") made the *How it works* page
* [Keith Williams](https://github.com/Marveljr1 "Keith's Github") made the *Login* page
* [Yosef Wolday](https://github.com/yosef-w "Yosef's Github") made the *Signup* page

Thanks for taking a look at our work!
